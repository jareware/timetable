# Description
A very simple HSL timetable showing "app". Select your bus stop and view the next buses scheduled to pass that stop.

# Development
Made with React.js and Bootstrap. 
Requirements: python, sass, npm and nodejs.

When starting for the first time, run ```npm install``` and ```gem install scss_lint```. And if you don't already have global grunt installed  ```npm install -g grunt-cli```.

Do your edits to the files in `src/`.

Run a simple HTTP server and grunt in separate terminals:
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
```
grunt
```

Go to ```localhost:8000```
